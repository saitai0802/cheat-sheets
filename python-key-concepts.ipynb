    "# [Embracing the Four Python Programming Styles](https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/python-programming-styles/)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four main Python coding styles: imperative, functional, object-oriented, and procedural. (Some people combine imperative and functional coding styles while others view them as completely separate styles.) You may or may not agree that all four forms are valid or even useful—but nevertheless Python makes them all available. Let’s take a look at the pros and cons of each approach as well as some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A brief overview of the four Python coding styles\n",
    "1. **Functional**: Every statement is treated as *a mathematical equation* and any forms of state or mutable data are avoided. The main advantage of this approach is that it lends itself well to parallel processing because there is no state to consider. Many developers prefer this coding style for recursion and for lambda calculus. (Note that Python’s implementation of functional programming deviates from the standard—read, is impure— because it’s possible to maintain state and create side effects if you’re not careful. [If you need a pure functional programming implementation, Haskell may be a better choice](https://caiorss.github.io/Functional-Programming/haskell/Functional_Programming_Concepts.html).)\n",
    "2. **Imperative**: Computation is performed as a direct change to program state. This style is especially useful when manipulating data structures and produces elegant yet simple code. Python fully implements this paradigm.\n",
    "3. **Object-oriented**: Relies on data fields that are treated as objects and manipulated only through prescribed methods. Python doesn’t fully support this paradigm because it can’t implement features such as data hiding (encapsulation), which [many believe is a primary requirement of the object-oriented programming paradigm](http://codebetter.com/raymondlewallen/2005/07/19/4-major-principles-of-object-oriented-programming/). This coding style also favors code reuse.\n",
    "4. **Procedural**: Tasks are treated as step-by-step iterations where common tasks are placed in functions that are called as needed. This coding style favors iteration, sequencing, selection, and modularization. Python excels in implementing this particular paradigm."

    "First lets understand iterators. According to Wikipedia, an iterator is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists. However, an iterator performs traversal and gives access to data elements in a container, but does not perform iteration. You might be confused so lets take it a bit slow. There are three parts namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterable**: An iterable is any object in Python which has an __iter__ or a __getitem__ method defined which returns an iterator or can take indexes (You can read more about them [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20551346)). In short an iterable is any object which can provide us with an iterator.\n",
    "- **Iterator**: An iterator is any object in Python which has a next (Python2) or __next__ method defined. \n",
    "- **Iteration**: In simple words it is the process of taking an item from something e.g a list. When we use a loop to loop over something it is called iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:** \n",
    "- Iterators provide a sequence interface to Python objects that’s memory efficient and considered Pythonic. \n",
    "- To support iteration an object needs to implement the iterator protocol by providing the __iter__ and __next__ dunder methods.\n",
    "- Class-based iterators are only one way to write iterable objects in Python. Also consider generators and generator expressions."

    "## Generator Expressions vs List Comprehensions\n",
    "In terms of syntax, the only difference is that you use parentheses instead of square brackets. However, the **type of data** returned by **list comprehensions** and **generator expressions** differs. The main advantage of generator over a list is that it takes much less memory. We can check how much memory is taken by both types using **sys.getsizeof()** method.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Generator calculates on the fly, so it is smaller.\n",
    "In case of generator, we receive only ”algorithm”/ “instructions” how to calculate that Python stores. And each time we call for generator, it will only “generate” the next element of the sequence on demand according to “instructions”.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generator calculates on the fly, so it is slower\n",
    "On the other hand, generator will be slower, as every time the element of sequence is calculated and yielded, function context/state has to be saved to be picked up next time for generating next value. That “saving and loading function context/state” takes time."
